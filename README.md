Eye Tracking for point gray cameras

Simple and fast eye tracking for head restrained applications.

Tracks pupil location and centroid size.

Outputs are x and y raw position over analog voltage outputs via NIDAQmx.
TCP/IP or zeroMQ interfaces are in the works.

Performance metrics and additional information can be found in:

REQUIRES open frameworks, flycapture2, boost NIDAQmx

Thanks to Bijan Pesaran for the cameras
